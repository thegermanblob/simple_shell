# Project:0x16.C-Simple Shell

## Introduction:

In this project is developed a simple **UNIX** command interpreter (shell) as a part of low-level programming foundation and algorithm--Linux and Unix system programming.

## Description:

A simple **UNIX** command interpreter is a program that reads commands from the standard input or files and executes them in order to display a result.

## Requirements:

### General:

+ Allowed editors: **vi**, **vim**, **emacs**
+ All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
+ Your C programs and functions will be compiled with **gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra** and **-pedantic**
+ All your files should end with a new line
+ A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
+ Your code should use the **Betty** style. It will be checked using [betty-style.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-style.pl) and [betty-doc.pl](https://github.com/holbertonschool/Betty/blob/master/betty-doc.pl)
+ Your shell should not have any memory leaks
+ No more than 5 functions per file
+ All your header files should be include guarded
+ Use system calls only when you need to ([why?]())

## Flowchart:

This is the [Flowchart]() that describes the process of the simple shell.
## Installation:

To use this shell first	of all you must	clone this repository, using the next c ommand:

`git clone https://github.com/thegermanblob/simple_shell.git
## How to compile it:
