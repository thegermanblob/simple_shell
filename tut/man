.TH Shell 3 "26 November 2019" "1.0" "Simple Shell Manual"

.SH NAME
.B Simple Shell - a simple UNIX command interpreter in C

.SH SYNOPSIS
simple_shell [command] [file]

.SH DESCRIPTION
The program runs based on bash commands obtained from the input stream by the
user. Any text seperated by a single space is considered to be an argument.
The respective command typed by the user is then executed as if in a UNIX shell.

A command is a sequence of non blank words separated by a blank space. The first
word specifies the name of the command to be executed and subsequent arguments
are considered to be flags associated with the command.

Lines on shell can be read interactively from standard output. It can also, be
read non-interactively where you can pipe in the file. It is designed so it can
act like Bash. It does not however, handle certain bash features
such as options.

.SH Arguments
From input, the first argument is assumed to be an executable command file. It
follows the parameters taken by that particular command.

.B hsh
is the executable that will interpret the command. It executes it and then,
exit. With exit, an exit status returns with the status of the previous command
executed. For instance, status is 0 on non-execution.

.SH INTERACTIVE MODE EXAMPLE
.PP
.PP
$ ./hsh
.PP
##---> /bin/ls
.PP
hsh main.c shell.c
.PP
##---> exit
.PP
$
.PP
.PP
.SH NON-INTERACTIVE MODE EXAMPLE
.PP
.PP
$ echo "/bin/ls" | ./hsh
.PP
.PP
hsh main.c shell.c test_ls_1
.SH ENVIRONMENT
When the simple shell is invoked, it is given an array of strings called
the environment. Note that string is a copy. The strings are environment
variables and are represented in this format
.B name=value
.
.SH BUILTIN COMMANDS
The following commands below are called and handled directly in the shell.
Therefore, these commands do not need to call upon a child process to be
executed. However, with the exit builtin it returns an exits status of 0
on successful execution. In failure, the exit will return 126 when the
command invoked can not execute. Also, it will return 127 when the command
is not found. It will return a value of 2 in failure--misuse of the shell
builtin.

The following commands are executed in the shell as builtins

.B exit

	Exits the shell

.B env

	Prints the variables from the current environment


.SH BUGS
No known bugs
