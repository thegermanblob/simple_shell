.SH DESCRIPTION

.B Simple shell
it is a simple version of a command line interpreter for the system. The simple shell read lines from either the terminal, interpretes them, and generally executes other commands. It incorporates mode interactive and non-interactive, the commands can be executed while the program is running or can be executing a command within a file directly by the shell.

.SS INVOCATION

To start the interactive mode the program will be executed, then starts the mode indicated by '$', to exit of the mode type 'exit' or type 'ctrl + d' and in the mode non-interactive the location that contains the command to be executed must be specified in the command line.

.SS EXECUTION

The program takes the arguments of the command line in a string and it is tokenizes into words using "space" as a delimiter, the first word is consider the command and all remaining are considered the arguments to that command. If the command is valid:

1. If the first argument is different to '.', '/' or shell builtin, the program searches in the PATH and then invocates it.
2. If the first character is '.' or '/', the program executes that typed command with the passed argument.
